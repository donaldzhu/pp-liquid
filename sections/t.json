  "caption": "When organic matter decomposes, it enters a state of both giving and receiving. Decaying trees become home to networks of insects and fungi, animal remains provide nutrients for scavengers and bacteria, an orange sitting idle in a bowl becomes a playground for mold spores.\n\nDeath comes with remediation. Endings give way to new beginnings. In this limbo, there is a fleeting feeling, a truth just beyond our grasp. A cultural patina exists to navigate this transition, questioning the space between living and nonliving, the suspension between old and new.\n\nWe find ourselves obsessed with negotiating this ‘in-between’: how we face the gradual loss of traditions, how we choose to preserve + remediate, and what we draw from the past in building our future.",
